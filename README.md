## Getting Started
To begin, make sure you have Git installed on your system. You can download and install Git from [link](doc:https://git-scm.com/downloads#link)
Next, configure Git with your username and email address using the following commands:
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## Basic Git Commands
1. Initialize a new Git repository:
```
git init
```
2. Check status of your repository:
```
git status
```
3. Add files to the staging area:
```
git add filename
```
4. Commit changes to the repository:
```
git commit -m "Commit message"
```
5. View commit history:
```
git log
```

## Branching and Merging
1. Create a new branch:
```
git branch branchname
```
2. Switch to a different branch:
```
git checkout branchname
```
3. Merge branches:
```
git merge branchname
```

## Collaborating with GitHub
1. Clone a repository from GitHub:
```
git clone repository_url
```
2. Add a remote repository:
```
git remote add origin repository_url
```
3. Push changes to a remote repository:
```
git push origin branchname
```
4. Pull changes from a remote repository:
```
git pull origin branchname
```
